# REST Express

## Project Overview

REST Express is a full-featured REST API built using Node.js, Express, and various libraries to facilitate modern web development practices. This project serves as a backend solution for applications requiring CRUD operations, leveraging a PostgreSQL database and supporting essential features such as user authentication, form validation, and API responses.

## Installation

To set up the project, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 and above) installed on your machine. Also, you will need to have a PostgreSQL database set up and the connection URL available.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rest-express.git
   cd rest-express
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables. You’ll need to create an `.env` file and add your `DATABASE_URL`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
   ```

4. Run the migrations:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit
   ```

5. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API endpoints via tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or directly from the front-end of your application.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/users** - Retrieve list of users
- **POST /api/users** - Create a new user
- **GET /api/users/:id** - Retrieve a specific user by ID
- **PUT /api/users/:id** - Update a user's information
- **DELETE /api/users/:id** - Delete a user

## Features

- RESTful API structure
- PostgreSQL database support
- User authentication with session management
- Form validation using [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Adaptive components based on Radix UI
- Front-end integration with React and React Query

## Dependencies

The project relies on several libraries and frameworks. Here's a summary of the required dependencies from `package.json`:

- `express`: Framework for building web applications.
- `pg` & `connect-pg-simple`: PostgreSQL client for Node.js and session store for Express.
- `bcrypt`: Library to hash passwords.
- `zod`: Type-safe schema declaration and validation.
- `@radix-ui/react-*`: A set of UI primitives for building responsive and accessible web applications.
- `@stripe/react-stripe-js`: Integration with Stripe for payments.
- `@tanstack/react-query`: Data fetching and state management tools.
